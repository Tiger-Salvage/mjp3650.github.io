    TIGER SALVAGE Synopsis: <br/> <br/>
    A research organization has been studying a super-volcano on the ocean bottom using a new innovative mini-submarine.
    Unfortunately the submarine has stopped responding to communication, and is feared lost with all of its important
    data. In the case of emergency the submarine is programmed to surface and sit on the surface in order to be located
    and retrieved. We need to rapidly retrieve this mini-submarine to use its critical data! To that end we have a boat
    out searching, which has a small fleet of drones to do the actual searching. These drones have their own control
    boards, but due to needing to operate out of sight of land, and afield of the boat, they have to be able to
    collaboratively and autonomously search the area around the boat, and communicate their status and success to an
    operator on the boat who can then sail out to pick up the mini-submarine.
